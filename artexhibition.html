        <h3>Problem</h3>
        <p>The hypothetical brief for the Barbican focuses on art exhibitions and a user would be able to:
             <ul>
                 <li>
                     Easily gain info about exhibits and make note of them for later
                 </li>
                 <li>
                     Build a profile of preferences
                 </li>
                 <li>
                     Receive recommendations about upcoming events based on profile
                 </li>
                 <li>
                     Book tickets and use in-exhibition interactivity in one app

            <h3>Discover</h3>
            <p>We analysed competitors with apps that could be used while in a museum or exhibition and found this reiterated the opportunity of integrating the booking and event in one app. There was also no clear choice for location-based triggers, as these ranged from Bluetooth to GPS.  
            </p>
            <p>
                We also conducted eleven user interviews including on-site and arranged meetings of exhibition-goers.

                <h3>Define</h3>
                <p>We then used the notes and quotes of the user interviews in affinity mapping. The affinity mapping informed the user persona Jamie and the overall needs (before, during and after an exhibition).

                <p>
                    Jamie is a tech savvy Londoner and an adaptable planner. ‘Auto-interactivity’ was an important feature for her as she wouldn’t want to be constantly pushing buttons. She would want the chosen technology to enhance not detract from her experience at the exhibition. We focused on using Bluetooth technology to automatically update exhibit info based on location. One of the constraints of Bluetooth is using a native app instead of a microsite. We designed the app for a mobile phone instead of a Barbican-owned tablet as Jamie would already have the phone on her and does not like carrying additional materials.

            <h3>Design</h3>
            <p>We ideated by doing Crazy 8’s on the best and worst scenarios. As a team, we then drew out the initial screen flows on a whiteboard and then transferred them to paper prototypes. The image on the left shows initial designs.

                <h3>Deliver</h3>
                <p>In our initial user testing, we learned that it was important to reflect the exhibition context in the user testing. If users were seated while testing, they did not fully understand the transition of scanning tickets and moving into the exhibition. So we adapted our testing strategy by having users enter a room and walk up to ‘paintings’ on the wall.
                </p>
                <p>
                We iterated on the flow, onboarding, and advancing from exhibit to exhibit.

            <h3>Prototype</h3>
            <p>We created a high-fidelity prototype, which is based on a specific scenario. Jamie has booked her ticket for the latest art exhibition through the app. She receives a notification to access her tickets just before the event. She can scan her ticket, enter the exhibit, and proceed to interactive mode. As it’s her first time, she will learn more about interactive mode before heading to the first exhibit, listening to audio, and liking the exhibit. Then next day she’ll receive recommendations about upcoming events.
            </p>
