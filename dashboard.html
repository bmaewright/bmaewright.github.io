            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>Dementia Friends is an initiative of the Alzheimer’s Society that focuses on educating the public about dementia. Champions are volunteers that run Information Sessions in the community and the attendees of these Sessions become Dementia Friends. The Alzheimer’s Society has a target to make 4 million Dementia Friends by 2020.
            </p>
            <h3>Problem</h3>
            <p>Our project focused on the redesign of the Champion’s online dashboard where they log the number of friends created, find resources, order materials, and complete other tasks.</p>

            <h3>Objective</h3>
            <p>Based on the brief, the initial stakeholder meeting, and our review of the current site we identified three main objectives:
                <ol>
                    <li>Determine the main device used by Champions</li>
                    <li>Improve discoverability of key tasks on the homepage</li>
                    <li>Improve discoverability of resources</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p>Design with dementia in mind, to ‘iterate designs gradually and judiciously’ by creating something familiar but improved upon.</p>

                <h3>User Research Methods</h3>
                <p>In the early phases of user research, we used a range of methods to find out more about Dementia Friends Champions and the Info Sessions they run.
                    <ol>
                        <li>We attended an Info Session held in the suburbs of London. The Champion leading the Session became one of our interviewees.</li>
                        <li>We conducted a thorough review of the current dashboard through a UAT site and a content audit on the 130 resources available.</li>
                        <li>163 Champions completed our survey, which confirmed our user interview findings that their main devices are larger screens such as desktop and laptops.</li>
                        <li>Of the 11 Champion interviews we conducted, I led four of them.</li>
                    </ol>
                </p>

            <h3>User Research Findings</h3>
            <p>
                <ol>
                    <li><span>The main device is desktop.</span>All 11 interviewees accessed the dashboard through desktop computers.</li>
                    <li><span>The dashboard should be a microsite.</span>At present, the dashboard is a webpage within the Dementia Friends website, so the global navigation does not relate to the dashboard. 4 out of 11 interviewees tried to navigate through the dashboard using the global nav. </li>
                    <li><span>Key tasks align with business understanding.</span>Champions prioritised 10 tasks and confirmed the business’ view of the top tasks.</li>
                    <li><span>Great resources but hard to find.</span>Champions were very impressed with resources, but often found them difficult to find.</li>
                    <li><span>Dashboard as main resource.</span>Improve discoverability so Champions do not need to contact their volunteer manager.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>1 Design Studio with 6 Dementia Friends team members at their office</p>
                <p>1 team session to pull ideas from the design studio, business needs and research findings to design the main pages</p>
                <p>16 user tests completed; 7 of which with Dementia Friends Champions</p>
                <p>4 rounds of testing, identifying trends and improvements to iterate on designs from paper to hi-fi prototype</p>

                    <h3>Resources Redesign</h3>
                    <p>Once a Champion arrives at the Resources page, they are able to access 130 resources separated into 7 categories. The example shown has ‘Planning & promoting’ selected and only the first of twenty-four resources is shown. In this setup, users have to know where the resource is located; otherwise, they dip in and out of each category looking for the particular handout.</p>
                    <p>Our redesign focused on discoverability by adding search functionality and moving from set categories to filters (audience and resource type) that could be used alone or in combination.</p>
                    <p>Another design decision was based on card sorting. To have a better understanding of the mental model, we had eleven potential users card sort a selection of resources. Eight of eleven sorters grouped Session Guides with their linked resources, as opposed to putting all guides in one group and all printable handouts in another. This informed the design by the creation of one card that would include guide and resource in a clear format.</p>

                    <p>
                        <ol>
                            <li> <span>Search.</span>The new search functionality was easily missed in the mid-fi so it was included at the top of the card and made more prominent using colour in the hi-fi prototype.</li>
                            <li> <span>Filters Instead of Tabs.</span>Users did not notice the additional filtering options in the mid-fi prototype and found the tabs confusing. In the hi-fi prototype, we moved to all dropdown filters, made the filters bolder using colour and added text to invite users to filter.</li>
                            <li> <span>Filter Copy.</span>As mentioned in 2, the categories on the tabs confused users. Champions found that a given resource could be in any of three categories. We iterated several times on the copy, changing unclear terms to specific phrases and grouping based on actions.</li>
                        </ol>

                        <h3>Client Feedback</h3>
                        <p>"Victoria, Brittany, Fabiola and Pinusa delivered a fantastic redesign of our volunteers online dashboard that met and exceeded our expectations for the project. Working to tight deadlines, the team were able to very quickly gain a deep understanding of who our users were and what they needed from their dashboard, as well as also keeping our business requirements in mind at all times. They showed genuine passion and dedication at every stage of the project, from the interviews they conducted with our users to the design studio workshop they lead for our team, right through to the final product. Every design decision that they made was backed up by evidence and informed by the feedback they received from our users. Their work resulted in an end product that we could take away and implement, confident in the knowledge that it would empower our volunteers to have even more of an impact. Working with such a skilful, friendly and professional team was an absolute pleasure - we would not hesitate to work with them again!"
