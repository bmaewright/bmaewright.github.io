    <p class="overview">2 week design sprint | Solo project | Concept Project at General Assembly</p>
    <p class="overview">The first week focused on developing an app from identifying user’s needs to paper prototype. In the second week, I developed the visual design to a hi-fi mockup.</p>

            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>My classmate Fiona is a well-travelled foodie who likes to share her great food experiences with friends and seek out their recommendations before she travels. As a vegetarian, she likes to share great veggie options with her vegan and vegetarian friends.
            </p>
            <h3>Problem</h3>
            <p>Remembering foreign restaurants, cafes and market stalls, may be difficult because the name and street are in a different language/alphabet. For Fiona being unable to recall these details some months later was frustrating because it meant she couldn’t pass on a great find.</p>

            <h3>Research</h3>
            <p>Through experience mapping and task analysis, I was better able to understand Fiona’s frustrations and behaviours. The main finding was the frustration of not being able to remember the eatery details months later, but other findings included:
                <ul>
                    <li>Fiona does take food photos but does not share via social media</li>
                    <li>While eating a meal she puts her phone away to be more present</li>
                    <li>She may take a business card when she leaves to remember</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>The aim was to build an app that allowed Fiona to quickly make note of her food experiences including photos and descriptions. She could then share those details and photos privately with friends.</p>

                <h3>Initial Concepts</h3>
                <p>Though the app will be able to handle recording, sharing, asking for and receiving recommendations, the most important aspects for Fiona were to record and share. For the recording, I focused on needs Fiona identified during user interviews — the app needed to include the eatery name, where it was located, what she ate and why it was so great.</p>

            <h3>Iterations</h3>
            <p>There were two major changes. The first was that Fiona wanted a way to be able to send recommendations outside of the app; so additional options to send via WhatsApp or email were included. The second change was making the note editable because Fiona wouldn’t use the same language for a friend as she would a boss.</p>
            <p>In the visual design phase, more iterations were completed to improve the layout using cards and to clarify the path by using primary and secondary buttons.</p>

                <h3>Result</h3>
                <p>The final stage was a hi-fi prototype. The scenario is that the user is in a restaurant and has just had a great meal. She thinks her friend Rachel would love this place, so she adds a new entry about the restaurant and sends it on to Rachel via the app.</p>

                <p>“The share with friends feature is perfect — exciting to be able to quickly recommend great places and give my friends insight that I may otherwise have forgotten! This app would save me all the time that I normally spend trawling through my notebooks for restaurant names or phone for photos.” -Fiona</p>
